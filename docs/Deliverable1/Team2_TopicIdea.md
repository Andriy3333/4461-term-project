Our proposed research topic is AI bots pretending to be humans on Social Networks. Specifically, official/large bodies using AI to push (mis)information campaigns, on platforms like X(Twitter), Reddit, Instagram, YouTube, etc. These bots usually collaborate with other bots to appear more authentic and increase their reach, and they can create fake grassroots movements and manipulate public opinion. With the ubiquity of social media, this "information warfare" can have a massive impact on the public, and may already be influencing major events such as elections. This is relevant to course themes as this topic intersects with ethics, major media ecosystems, and AI to AI and AI to human interactions.
